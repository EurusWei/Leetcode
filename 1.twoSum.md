## Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
```
## Thoughts
- Iterate the list, for each element, check if the difference between it and the target is in the list
- If it's in the list, and it's not the same element, return the pair of indices
## Tricks
- Find the index of an element in a list: list.index()
- list.append()
## Solution
- Python
```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """Assume num is a list, target is a number, find the pair of indexs that the sume
           is equal to target"""
        pair = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            diff = target - nums[i]
            if diff in nums and nums.index(diff) != i:
                pair.append(i)
                pair.append(nums.index(diff))
                return pair
```
